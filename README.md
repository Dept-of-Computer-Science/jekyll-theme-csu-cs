## Usage


### Quick List of Includes

Includes most courses should include:

* `resources/university.html`  - includes tilt, counselling, and canvasTech with headers under a 'University Resources'
header. **Most courses should include this**. 
* `policies/policiesAll.html` - lists policies related to CSU Principles of Community, includes all policies. 


General Useful Includes:
* `resources/eclipse.html` - eclipse install information.

* `disqus_comments.html` - Code to markup disqus comment box.
* `footer.html` - Defines the site's footer section. Contains standard CS department links, and uses
the site description in the bottom right panel. 
* `head.html` - Code-block that defines the `<head></head>` in *default* layout.
* `header.html` - Defines the site's main header section. By default, pages with a 
defined `title` attribute will have links displayed here.

### Navigation Features

#### External Links in Top Menu

If you wish to have external links (for example canvas login) in the top menu bar, put each
link in the _config.yml file under `top-nav-external`. Each link
needs to have a `title` and `url`. For example:

```yaml
top-nav-external:
  - title: Canvas
    url: http://canvas.colostate.edu
``` 

#### no-nav

By including no-nav in your site data, the page will not show up in the navigation menu, even if
the page is a top-level page. For example:

```
---
layout: page
title: Virtual Help Desk Instructions
no-nav: true
permalink: help-desk/
---
```

#### Order

While jekyll defaults to alphanumeric order, by adding the `order` attribute. For example:
```
---
layout: page
title: Resources
order: 3
permalink: resources/
---
```

### HelpDesk Hours / Table
The theme comes with a dynamic table that adjust based on screen size. An example of
formatting of the table is as follows. The classes are essential. 

```html
   <h2>Helpdesk Times</h2>
    <table id="calendar">
        <caption>For Su2020 all helpdesk hours will be online. See: <a href="/~cs150/.Summer20/help-desk/">help desk instructions</a></caption>
        <tr class="weekdays">
            <th id="time" scope="col">Time (MDT)</th>
            <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
            <th scope="col">Monday</th>
            <th scope="col">Tuesday</th>
            <th scope="col">Wednesday</th>
